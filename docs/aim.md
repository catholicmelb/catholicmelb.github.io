# Aim

The aim of this Handbook is to provide all parishes throughout the Archdiocese of Melbourne with guidelines on parish administration and management, including the administration of parish goods. These guidelines should be viewed as a minimum for each parish to follow.

They should be read in conjunction with the Parish Finance Committee Statutes of the Archdiocese of Melbourne and the Code of Canon Law
