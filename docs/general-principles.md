# 2.1 General Principles

## 2.1.1 The Person in Charge of Administration
 
The general principle is that the Bishop is responsible for the administration of a diocese, and the Parish Priest is responsible for the administration of a parish.  The Bishop may entrust the administration of the parish to another person who is not a Priest, but must appoint a priest to be ultimately responsible for the pastoral care of the parish.  

The Bishop is responsible for administering the goods belonging to the diocese while the Parish Administrator is responsible for those belonging to the parish.  

The Bishop is to supervise carefully the administration of all the goods which belong to the parishes, and to ensure the effective administration of church goods by issuing Parish Finance Committee Statutes.

## 2.1.2 Summary of Canons and Respective Roles
 
It is the responsibility of the Bishop to supervise carefully the administration of all goods that belong to parishes of the Diocese (canon 1276, §1).
 
In attending to this responsibility, the Bishop issues special instructions for administration of church goods and property (canon 1276, §2).  
 
The parish priest is the administrator of the assets of the parish (canon 532).  He is to carry out this task of administration in accord with the norms of canons 1281-1288.  In place of a parish priest, the Bishop may appoint a parish administrator.  All the financial responsibilities of a parish priest apply equally to parish administrators, with the proviso that no changes take place, which would prejudice the rights of a subsequently appointed parish priest.  References to parish priests in this Handbook, includes reference to parish administrators where appointed.
 
Canon 537 makes it obligatory that there be a finance committee in each parish to assist the parish priest in regard to his responsibilities for financial and administrative matters.
 
The existence of the finance committee does not detract from the parish priest’s standing as the one who acts in the name of the parish (canon 532).  However, such a Committee provides the parish priest with valuable insight and advice, so that he may act more effectively in the interests of the parish.
 
Careful adherence to any instructions issued by the Archbishop is required by parish priests and finance committees. If Diocesan policy and Canon Law requirements are not complied with, a particular transaction may be invalid under Canon Law and possibly under civil law as well.
 
There are certain situations where Canon Law, through the norms issued by the local bishop, requires a parish priest to consult with and obtain the advice of the Parish Finance Committee (PFC).  The parish priest is not bound in any way to accept the Committee’s advice, even if unanimous; nevertheless, there must be some overriding reason for not doing so.
